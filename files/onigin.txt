My uncle has the most honest rules,
When seriously ill,
He forced himself to respect himself
And I couldn't think of a better one.
His example to others is science;
But, my God, what a bore
Sit with the patient day and night,
Without taking a step away!
What low cunning
Half - dead to amuse,
He has pillows to fix,
It's sad to bring medicine,
Sigh and think about yourself:
When the devil will take you!
